# Python-Projects

# pip skillset

If you want to share your project and you do have a lot of dependencies, go and make a requirements.txt file.
Create a new folder e.g. "project" - put all you code into a new folder "description/of/function" e.g. "converter"
Inside projects create a new folder "scripts" , cd into it and call:

```python
pip freeze > requirements.txt 
```

Now you have writen all your pip requirements into this file with every needed version.
If you want to improve - go and delete the ones one do not need to run your project.
